# Sisyphus

A workflow manager in Python.


# Installation

## Requirements

Sisyphus requires a Python >=3.6 installation with the following additional libraries:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

  Optional if curse based user interface should be used:

    pip3 install urwid

  Optional if web interface should be used:

    pip3 install flask

  Optional to compile documentation:

    pip3 install Sphinx
    pip3 install sphinxcontrib-mermaid

  Optional if virtual file system should be used:

    pip3 install fusepy
    sudo addgroup $USER fuse  # depending on your system

  Optional for a nicer traceback

    pip3 install better_exchook

## Setup

* After the requirements are installed, install `sis`. This can be done with
  ```
  pip3 install git+https://github.com/rwth-i6/sisyphus.git
  ```
* The current directory (`pwd`), when you run `sis`, should have a file `settings.py` (see `example` dir).
* Create a directory `work` in the current dir.
  All data created while running the jobs will be stored there.
* Create a directory `output` in the current dir.
  All the registered output will end up here.
* Create a directory `alias` in the current dir.
* Run `sis --config some_config.py m`.


# Documentation

# Example

A short toy workflow example is given in the example directory.

To run sisyphus on the example workflow change into the `/example` directory and run `../sis manager`

A large realistic workflow will soon be added.

# Development

If you want to commit to the repository make sure to run the unittest and check for PEP 8 by running tox.
All need tools can be installed by running:

    pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt

To automatically check for PEP 8 errors before committing run:

    pre-commit install

The unittest and flake8 on all relevant files is done by running tox:

    tox

# Known Problems:

* blocks may don't work correctly if used together with the async workflow
