You can start the workflow by running:
`sis manager config/workflow.main`

- `config/workflow.py` contains the workflow definition, start here reading the code and comments
- `recipe/` contains the modules which define the actual jobs
- - `tools.py` continue reading here
- - `splitter/__init__.py` read this file last
