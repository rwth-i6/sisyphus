    Create engine object used to submit jobs. The simplest setup just creates a local
    engine starting all jobs on the local machine e.g.::

        from sisyphus.localengine import LocalEngine
        return LocalEngine(cpu=8)

    The usually recommended version is to use a local and a normal grid engine. The EngineSelector
    can be used to schedule tasks on different engines. The main intuition was to have an engine for
    very small jobs that don't required to be scheduled on a large grid engine (e.g. counting lines of file).
    A setup using the EngineSelector would look like this::

        from sisyphus.localengine import LocalEngine
        from sisyphus.engine import EngineSelector
        from sisyphus.son_of_grid_engine import SonOfGridEngine

                              default_engine='long')
